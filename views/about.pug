          //- Replace the boilerplate below with your best elevator pitch
          p I am a Web Developer who is always eager to learn and solve problems. While I may not have an extremely comprehensive breadth of technologies or skills at my disposal, I am always looking to learn and be taught. I started my journey of learning how to code almost two months ago, and am now deeply enjoying every moment I get to learn more and apply what I have learned to create something. I look forward to continuing to create and develop with others in the future as well.
